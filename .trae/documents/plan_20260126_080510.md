## Plan to Fix Git Push Error

### Problem Analysis
The error `src refspec main does not match any` occurs because:
- You're on branch `main` but it has **no commits yet**
- Git requires at least one commit before pushing a branch to a remote

### Solution Steps
1. **Stage the files** - Add all untracked files to staging
2. **Make initial commit** - Create the first commit with a meaningful message
3. **Push to remote** - Now that there's a commit, push should succeed

### Execution Commands
```bash
# Stage all files
git add .

# Create initial commit
git commit -m "Initial commit"

# Push to remote with upstream tracking
git push -u origin main
```

This will resolve the error and successfully push your repository to GitHub.
